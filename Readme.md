# Flex and Bison Program

## Overview
This repository contains a Flex and Bison program for creating a lexical analyzer and parser for a specific language. Flex and Bison are tools for generating scanners and parsers, respectively, from formal specifications. This README serves as a guide to setting up and running the Flex and Bison program.

## Requirements
- Flex
- Bison
- C/C++ compiler (e.g., gcc)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/flex-bison-program.git
    cd flex-bison-program
    ```

## Usage
1. Write the Flex specification file `lexer.l` to define the tokens of your language.
2. Write the Bison specification file `parser.y` to define the grammar rules of your language.
3. Write the main program in C or C++ (`main.c`) that utilizes the lexer and parser generated by Flex and Bison.
4. Compile the Flex specification:
    ```bash
    flex lexer.l
    ```
5. Compile the Bison specification:
    ```bash
    bison -d parser.y
    ```
6. Compile the main program along with the generated lexer and parser files:
    ```bash
    gcc -o my_program main.c lex.yy.c parser.tab.c -lfl
    ```
    Here, `my_program` is the name of the executable file.
7. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./my_program
    ```
